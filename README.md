# 3DDGD: 3D Deepfake Generation and Detection Using 3D Face Meshes

This is the official PyTorch implementation of **3DDGD**.

**3DDGD** project focuses on enhancing security in 3D facial biometric systems by detecting deepfakes on 3D face meshes. Leveraging the unique advantages of 3D facial features over 2D, we created a dataset of real and fake 3D faces and developed advanced models, including mesh-based multi-layer perceptrons, self-attention mechanisms, and TabTransformer architectures, for accurate 3D deepfake detection. Our results demonstrate that 3D face meshes significantly improve the ability to distinguish real faces from deepfakes, paving the way for more secure biometric authentication and virtual interactions.
