This is the official PyTorch implementation of **3DDGD**, a project focused on enhancing the security of 3D facial biometric systems by detecting deepfakes in 3D face meshes.

Leveraging the unique geometric richness of 3D data over traditional 2D images, **3DDGD** introduces a dataset of real and fake 3D faces, along with advanced deep learning models, including mesh-based multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), self-attention mechanisms, and TabTransformer architectures, to accurately distinguish authentic identities from forgeries. Our results demonstrate that 3D facial meshes offer a significant advantage in deepfake detection, supporting more secure biometric authentication and virtual identity systems.

Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and run inference or training.

#### 🔄 1- Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hichemfelouat/3DDGD.git 
cd 3DDGD
```
##### 2- Create and activate the Conda environment:
```bash
conda create --name 3DDGD python=3.10
conda activate 3DDGD
```
#### 3- Install PyTorch and CUDA dependencies:
```bash
conda install pytorch==2.3.1 torchvision==0.18.1 torchaudio==2.3.1 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia

### 🚀 Inference
To run inference using a pretrained model, follow these steps:

#### 📥 Step 1: Download Pretrained Weights

- Download the pretrained weights from the provided [link](https://www.).
- Unzip the contents into the `weights/` folder.

#### ▶️ Step 2: Run Inference

Use the following command:

```bash
python inference.py --input_data examples --model_name Mesh_MLP_MHA --feature_type G0 --is_cropped 0
```
```bash
Arguments:
--input_data: Path to the input 3D mesh directory 
--model_name: Name of the model architecture to use 
--feature_type: Type of input features (e.g., G0, G1, etc.)
--is_cropped: Set to 1 if the input meshes are cropped, 0 otherwise
```

You can download a free .obj format example file [here](https://www.artec3d.com/3d-models/head).

### 🧠 Training

To train the models, follow these steps:

1. 🔧 **Prepare the training data**:  
   - Convert files to `.obj` format if needed.  
   - Perform feature extraction as required by your model.  
   - Create the necessary CSV files to organize the training data.

2. ⚙️ **Train the models**:  
   - Each model has its own training script located in its respective folder.  
   - Update the script with the correct file paths and adjust the hyperparameters as needed before training.
